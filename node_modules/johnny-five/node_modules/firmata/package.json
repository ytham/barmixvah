It also assumes you have an Arduino Uno running firmata 2.2 with a photocell and an LED hooked up.\n#Usage\n    \n    var firmata = require('firmata');\n    var board = new firmata.Board('path to usb',function(){\n      //arduino is ready to communicate\n    });  \n#REPL\nIf you run *firmata* from the command line it will prompt you for the usb port.  Then it will present you with a REPL with a board variable available.\n#Board\n  The Board object is where all the functionality is for the library.\n##attributes\n  *Board.MODES*\n    \n    {\n     INPUT:0x00,\n     OUTPUT:0x01,\n     ANALOG:0x02,\n     PWM:0x03,\n     SERVO:0x04   \n    }\n  This is an enumeration of the different modes available.  This are used in calls to the *pinMode* function.\n\n  *Board.HIGH* and *Board.LOW*\n\n  These are constants used to set a digital pin low or high.  Used in calls to the *digitalWrite* function.\n\n  *Board.pins*\n\n  This is an array of all the pins on the arduino board.\n\n  Each value in the array is an object:\n\n    {\n     mode://current mode of pin which is on the the board.MODES.\n    ,value://current value of the pin. when pin is digital and set to output it will be Board.HIGH or Board.LOW.  If the pin is an analog pin it will be an numeric value between 0 and 1023.\n    ,supportedModes://an array of modes from board.MODES that are supported on this pin.\n    ,analogChannel://will be 127 for digital pins and the pin number for analog pins.\n    }\n\n  This array holds all pins digital and analog. To get the analog pin number as seen on the arduino board use the analogChannel attribute.\n\n  *Board.analogPins*\n\n  This is an array of all the array indexes of the analog pins in the *Board.pins* array.  \n  For example to get the analog pin 5 from the *Board.pins* attributes use:\n\n    board.pins[board.analogPins[5]];\n##methods\n    board.pinMode(pin,mode)\n\n  Set a mode for a pin.  pin is the number of the pin and the mode is on of the Board.MODES values.\n\n    board.digitalWrite(pin,value)\n\n  Write an output to a digital pin.  pin is the number of the pin and the value is either board.HGH or board.LOW.\n\n    board.digitalRead(pin,callback)\n\n  Read a digital value from the pin.  Evertime there is data for the pin the callback will be fired with a value argument.  \n\n    board.analogWrite(pin,value)\n\n  Write an output to an analog pin.  pin is the number of the pin and the value is between 0 and 255.  \n\n    board.analogRead(pin,callback)\n\n  Read an input for an analog pin.  Every time there is data on the pin the callback will be fired with a value argument. \n\n    board.servoWrite(pin,degree)\n  Write a degree value to a servo pin.\n  \n    board.sendI2CConfig(delay)\n  Set I2C Config on the arduino\n\n\n    board.sendI2CWriteRequest(slaveAddress,[bytes])\n\n  Write an array of bytes to a an I2C device.\n\n    board.sendI2CReadRequest(slaveAddress,numBytes,function(data))\n\n  Requests a number of bytes from a slave I2C device.  When the bytes are received from the I2C device the callback is called with the byte array.\n  \n## License \n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Julian Gautier &lt;julian.gautier@alumni.neumont.edu&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
